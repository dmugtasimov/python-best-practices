# Continuous Learning

Learning has been a constant companion in my work for over 20 years. This is how I think about it
and why I haven't stopped, even in the AI era.

## Two Ways to Work

There are two modes you can operate in.

The first is *just get things done*. You ship fast, but this is
genuinely good only for short-term results. But it doesn't compound. You complete things quickly, but
each task starts from roughly the same place as the last one.

The second is what I've settled into: embedding learning into the work itself. Not as a separate
phase, not as something scheduled for later — just as a natural part of how I approach problems.
The cost is some extra time in the short term. The payoff is that I get better at the work,
continuously, and that improvement compounds fast. This also allow to ship fast later, but at higher quality.

I've found that when I'm learning, I naturally try to do things the right way. I don't blindly copy
from the internet. I understand what I'm putting in. That care tends to produce better results, not
just better understanding.

## Why Learning Still Matters in the AI Era

This is the question I've been sitting with lately, and I think the answer is clearly: yes, you
should keep learning, even now.

Here's why.

### You have to be able to judge what AI gives you

AI generates impressive code. Sometimes it
generates solutions I wouldn't have thought of myself. But if I don't understand those solutions, I
can't evaluate whether they're correct, appropriate, or maintainable. If I don't know enough to
judge, I'm forced into one of two bad positions: trust the AI blindly, or reject it blindly. Neither
is good. Knowledge is what lets you actually use AI well.

### You're still the person responsible

When something breaks in production, it's not the AI's
problem. It's mine. AI sometimes makes real mistakes — logic errors, missed edge cases, solutions that work in
isolation but not in context. Even without that there maybe issues related with AI-generated code that require understanding it.
When that happens, I need to be able to diagnose what went wrong and
fix it. If I don't understand what was generated, I'm stuck — and AI may not be able to help me
get unstuck, especially when the problem is complex and involve a wide context.

### Sometimes describing the task is harder than doing it

Transferring context to AI is often the bottleneck. Everything you need to communicate — the constraints,
the history, the shape of the problem — has to be articulated from scratch. But all of that context is
already assembled in your head. When the gap between what you know and what you'd have to write to convey it is large enough,
it's simply faster to implement the thing yourself or give AI a low level implementation instructions.
That capability requires knowledge.

### Complex problems still require human depth

AI can fail on genuinely hard problems. At some
point — on the hardest tasks — you still have to dive in yourself. If you've stopped learning along
the way, that moment is a wall.

## How I Balance It Now

Things have shifted. There's real pressure to ship faster, and AI makes that possible in ways that
didn't exist before. I do sometimes skip learning a detail when speed matters more. That's a
legitimate trade-off.

But I haven't abandoned the habit. Learning is still embedded in most of what I do. When AI
generates something I don't understand, I try to understand it before moving on. When I'm solving
something complex, I try to understand it deeply enough that I could explain it or debug myself.

The balance has shifted — more weight on shipping, slightly less on depth in every individual
decision — but the underlying principle hasn't changed. You have to know what you're doing. AI
doesn't eliminate that requirement. It changes the shape of it.

## The Principle I Keep Coming Back To

If you rely entirely on AI and don't understand what you're building, you're making a bet that AI
will always be there, always be correct, and always be able to help you fix what it got wrong. That
bet has failed me enough times that I don't make it. Continuous learning is the hedge against that
failure — and it's a hedge that pays for itself in every complex problem I've ever had to solve.
